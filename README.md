This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**This is a fictional website, any copyright or trademarks are not intentionally being infringed on. Any images used were 
grabbed from Google. There was no intention of theft of images or names.**

This is my final project for my CMP course 464, that displays the useage of redux to grab items from pages and to store
them into a location page.

You should be able to press the button "Add to cart" to store the item selected into the cart. You should see the cart
update and indicate however many items you may have in the cart.

The cart should show the items that you have selected by name, and image, and show the prices along with the total amount.


Not every item will have the buttons operate since the point is driven home after using the buttons the first few times
and going to the cart to interact with the items there.
